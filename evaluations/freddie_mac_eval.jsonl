Investment properties limited to 2% regardless of LTV. Contributions can pay closing costs, prepaids, discount points, and other concessions but cannot exceed actual charges.

{"query": "How soon after closing can I rent out my primary residence?", "context": "", "response": "", "ground_truth": "For primary residence financing, you must occupy the property within 60 days of closing and maintain occupancy for at least 12 months.

Only reported tip income can be used (unreported tips not acceptable). Year-to-date pay stubs should show consistency with historical average when annualized.

{"query": "What if I have disputed accounts on my credit report?", "context": "", "response": "", "ground_truth": "Disputed accounts require special handling: if dispute causes debt exclusion from credit score, lender must include payment in DTI or require borrower to pay off/remove dispute. Medical collections under certain thresholds generally don't require payoff. Non-medical disputed accounts may need resolution: borrower can pay off account, provide documentation supporting dispute validity, or remove dispute and allow account to be scored. Cumulative disputed balances above thresholds must be addressed. Explanation of dispute required. Strategy of disputing accounts to temporarily boost scores is detected and may cause loan denial."}
{"query": "Can borrowed funds be used for down payment?", "context": "", "response": "", "ground_truth": "Generally no - borrowed funds (unsecured loans, credit cards, cash advances) cannot be used for down payment or closing costs. Exceptions: approved Community Seconds programs from government/nonprofit/employer, secured loans against borrower's own assets (401k loans with payment in DTI, margin loans against stocks), or subordinate financing from family documented as gift of equity.

Borrower must occupy one unit as primary residence. Rental income from non-occupied units can offset PITI using 75% of gross market rent. All units must be inspected and appraised. Reserve requirements increase with more units. Multi-unit properties help borrowers qualify with rental income offset but require more documentation and lower LTV than single-family homes."}
